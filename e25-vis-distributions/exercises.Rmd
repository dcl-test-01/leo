```{r setup, include=FALSE}
# knitr options
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# Libraries
library(tidyverse)

# Parameters
  # File with ideology scores for US House of Representatives
file_ideology <- "../../data/congress/ideology_house.rds"

#===============================================================================

# Recent storms data
storms_recent <-
  storms %>% 
  filter(year > 2013)

# Ideology scores for US House of Representatives
ideology <- read_rds(file_ideology)
```

__q1__ Use `theme()` to make the following adjustments to this plot:

* Turn the plot background white
* Turn both minor and major grid lines gray
* Change the axis text to size 12

```{r}
storms_recent %>% 
  ggplot(aes(wind)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 10)
```


__q2__ The `storms_recent` data is a subset of the `dplyr::storms` data that includes only recent storms. Use `storms_recent` to recreate the following plots. 

Note: For all plots, show your code.

__q2.1__

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("data/q2.1.png")
```


__q2.2__

```{r, echo = FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("data/q2.2.png")
```


__q3__ Improve upon this `diamonds` plot that tried to visualize the distribution of `carat` for different values of `cut`.

```{r, q3}
diamonds %>% 
  filter(carat < 2.5) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(carat, fill = cut)) + 
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 0.1) +
  scale_fill_discrete()
```


__q4__ `ideology` contains data on the ideological views for Democrat and Republican  members of the US House of Representatives from eight different Congresses (1945, 1955, 1965, 1975, 1985, 1995, 2005, and 2015). 

```{r}
ideology %>% 
  slice(1:10) %>% 
  knitr::kable()
```

`score` is the [NOMINATE first dimension estimate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NOMINATE_(scaling_method)). A `score` of -1 indicates that the member is extremely liberal, while a `score` of 1 indicates that they are extremely conservative. The data is available from [voteview.com](https://voteview.com/data).

__q4.1__ Create three completely different EDA plots that show the relationship between `year`, `party`, and `score`.

__q4.2__ Choose your best plot from __q4.1__ and turn it into a presentation plot.

<!-- Use following chunk for plot. -->

```{r, q4.2, out.width="100%"}

```
